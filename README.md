# DSA_Project2
This project involves the implementation of priority-based scheduling and network optimization algorithms in C, utilizing Max-Heaps for dynamic resource allocation, Kruskal’s Algorithm for minimum spanning tree construction, and BFS/Bellman-Ford algorithms for network path analysis and risk assessment.
